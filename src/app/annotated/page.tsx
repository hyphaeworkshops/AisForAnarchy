      <p>A is for Anarchy</p>
      <p>I&apos;m writing a book about anarchy without having first read any anarchist literature.  That&apos;s ok because I&apos;m an anarchist.</p>
      <p>Building Community</p>
      <p>Is the community we live in one that was built for us and by us?  If so, we need to keep it up!  If not, what&apos;s stopping us from building a community to live in that is built for us and by us?</p>
      <p>Dancing Effortlessly</p>
      <p>There is a constant dance of competing needs and wants for resources occurring all around us all the time.  Both within our communities and between our communities.  Pulling a resource here requires applying effort there, like dancers leading each other across a floor.  The more we face this reality, the more we can participate in the dance.  The more we participate in the dance, the more effortlessly we can direct the flow to keep it beautiful.</p>
      <p>Future Generations</p>
      <p>Children can learn to participate from a young age, or they can learn to surrender to others from a young age.  I hope readers fall into the former, but if they fall into the latter, remember we care for them, too.</p>
      <p>Having Intention</p>
      <p>What is it you are trying to accomplish?  Putting intention into your actions is how you get from where you are to where you want to be.  Sharing intention is how you bring others on board.</p>
      <p>Joyous Kaleidoscope</p>
      <p>Although there is power in combined effort towards a singular goal, much of the beauty in life arises from the fact that we all have different ideas on what we&apos;d like to create and contribute.</p>
      <p>Loving Myself</p>
      <p>I love myself enough to believe that I can contribute to the lives of those around me.  I love those around me enough to believe they can contribute to my life in the same way.</p>
      <p>Nurturing Others</p>
      <p>A strong community has strong community members.  Helping someone is a direct way to improve your life by improving your community.</p>
      <p>Punks Queers</p>
      <p>A subculture and an opporessed minority that have both seen the writing on the wall for the capitalistic society we live in, working to build something better.</p>
      <p>Rejecting Systems</p>
      <p>If a system doesn&apos;t work for us, we reject it.  Many systems we live in were put in place hundreds or thousands of years ago by people wealthier than any of our ancestors.  Let&apos;s reject those systems.</p>
      <p>Together United</p>
      <p>We are only strong enough to reject oppressive systems when we remain united across any and all superficial lines.  Look at the power systems to see where to draw lines.</p>
      <p>Vegan Wishes</p>
      <p>Although animals can&apos;t exactly join us in building community, it is difficult to reconcile their exploitation while also wishing to uplift those around us.  I won&apos;t say you have to be vegan, but I wish you would be.  It hurts to watch fellow beings hurt.</p>
      <p>Xylophone Youth</p>
      <p>X is for Xylophone.  It&apos;s a great instrument to let youth bang on to get a feel for the creative energy they want to harness to build their world.</p>
      <p>Z is for Zines</p>
      <p>This is my first, but it&apos;s not the first.  Thanks to everyone else who did it before and everyone else who&apos;ll do it some more.</p>
