      <p>This is the text for the first edition of my ABC book, A is for Anarchy.</p>
      <p>It will likely first be physically published as a zine, though I'd like to eventually turn it into a board book.  Phsyical publication is all the more important for an ABC book as I at least want my children living in the physical world before the digital one.</p>
      <p>If you also wish to publish this, or modify it and create your own edition, by all means.  That's the point.  Please note the CC-BY-SA license.</p>
      <p>It is intended that B and C, for example, be on pages such that if the book is open to B it is also open to C.</p>
